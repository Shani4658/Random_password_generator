This project features a Random Password Generator web application, designed to create secure passwords. The HTML structure includes a title, a password display area, and a button to generate new passwords. Users can view the generated password and use a copy button to easily copy it to the clipboard. The JavaScript file handles the core functionality, generating a 12-character password with a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to ensure strength and security. The script also includes a function to copy the generated password to the clipboard. Together, the HTML and JavaScript provide a user-friendly tool for creating and managing strong passwords.
